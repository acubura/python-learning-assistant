# Python Teaching Assistant 🤖🐍

## 🌟 Overview
**Python Teaching Assistant** is an interactive, beginner-friendly console program designed to teach Python fundamentals in a simple, guided, and engaging way.

Instead of learning from long theory or textbooks, this assistant behaves like a **personal Python tutor**. It talks with the user, asks what they want to learn, and explains each concept using **real-life analogies, step-by-step guidance, and optional examples**.

It is perfect for learners who want a **friendly and interactive introduction to Python programming**.

## 🧠 How It Works

When you start the program:

1. The assistant introduces itself  
2. It asks if you have a Python question  
3. It offers a menu of Python topics  
4. You choose what to learn  
5. The assistant explains the topic step-by-step  
6. You can choose to see examples or skip  
7. Learning continues topic by topic at your pace  

You can type:
- **yes / y** → Learn the topic  
- **no / n / skip** → Skip the topic  
- **exit** → End the session anytime  

The assistant understands flexible human-like responses, not just strict commands.
